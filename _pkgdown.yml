- title: "Probably the only function you'll ever need"
  desc: >
    Runs all of the other functions in the correct order to produce a
    compressed CSV file at "general/calendar/unlinked_lr_data" in the
    IPUMS DHS folder.
- contents:
  - "make_lr"

- title: "Functions that derive variables from calendar strings"
  desc: >
    Each of these functions checks to see if a given calendar is available
    for your sample and, if so, calculates all of derived variables
    associated with that calendar. If a calendar is not available for your
    sample, placeholder variables will be created (all values will be coded
    NA). As a result, all samples will have the same number of columns.

- title: "Read and Reshape an IR file"
  desc: >
    Because white-space characters can be meaningful in DHS calendar strings,
    we use a modified version of \code{ipumsr::read_ipums_micro} to hold it
    in place. We also only import variables that are necessary for working
    with calendar data (improving the speed of import). We then check each
    calendar string from anomolous formatting and generate specific errors with
    instructions for next-steps. Finally, we parse each string and pivot the
    single-character codes into independent rows, resulting in a data frame
    that is (usually) 80 times longer than the original IR file.

    locating important files.

- title: "Clean-up and Write an LR file"
  desc: >
    Remove any extraneous information and finish processing the derived
    calendar data as a compressed CSV file.
